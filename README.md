        <h3>i used to be a geek.. the return!</h3><br>
        
        <h2>the 90s never left me. i'm gonna tell you all about it</h2>
        <p>i've always been a quiet child. my best friends have always been my books, video games, walkman, radio.. a lot of imagination i had. i used to imagine myself living in these electronic devices. imagining another world, a world that existed deeply within me.
            i was born in the late 80s and i remember the sweetness and wildness of the 90s with a vivid nostalgia. when computers came into our life, major changes came along. oohh how i remember.. and internet! internet truly changed my perspectives in life.
            
           <br><br>i've always been a geek. being passionate about finding answers to my endless questions. finding ways to expend my brain and imagination. how do peple make video-games? can i live in my video games? how? and who are this people? how can i be like them?
